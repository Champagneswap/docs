# SYRUP Pool

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your CHAM to get SYRUP
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that SYRUP and start earning tokens from brand new BSC projects

This is galaxy mega brain CHAM compounding.

Your CHAM is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds… “sweet”, right? 😏

**SYRUP Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the ChampagneSwap community!**

Cristal Pool allows Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to SYRUP token holders.

Cristal Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the ChampagneSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Cristal Pool but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since ChampagneSwap has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@panchamswap/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), SYRUP Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) BSC community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the ChampagneSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).

**Extending the utility of SYRUP tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, stacking CHAM block rewards and the \(upcoming\) Golden Cristal lottery are some of the SYRUP token’s core utility functions… for now.

With SYRUP Pool, a new function has been offered for SYRUP holders in ChampagneSwap: adding the toppings to $SYRUP and the $CHAM.
