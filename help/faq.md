![](<../.gitbook/assets/docs masthead (17).png>)

This FAQ page answers some of the more commonly asked questions from the ChampagneSwap community.


## How can I stake CHAM?

You can stake your CHAM in ChampagneSwap Cristal Pools. Visit the [Cristal Pools page](https://panchamswap.finance/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Cristal Pools guide](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/products/cristal-pool/cristal-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Cristal Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more CHAM by supporting ChampagneSwap.

Staking only needs some CHAM to be added to a Cristal Pool to earn CHAM or other tokens.\

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn CHAM.\

## How do I farm?

We have a [Yield Farming guide](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) if you're interested in learning how to farm.

## Where can I view the ChampagneSwap roadmap?

You can [view our to-do list here, but don't call it a roadmap](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/roadmap).

## How do I connect my wallet to Binance Smart Chain and ChampagneSwap?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to ChampagneSwap guide](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for ChampagneSwap?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/get-started/wallet-guide) that's right for you.

## Why is my transaction failing?

You can check the status of a transaction on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com).

Our [Troubleshooting Errors guide](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/help/troubleshooting) may have a solution for your problem if you're having issues.

You can also see our [Fixing Stuck Pending Transactions guide](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/help/unsticking-a-transaction-stuck-as-pending-with-metamask) if you have a stuck transaction.

## When will you open more pools?

New Pools are added to ChampagneSwap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

Join the [announcements Telegram group](https://t.me/ChampagneSwapAnn) to learn about new Pools as early as possible.

## Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on ChampagneSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to ChampagneSwap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## How can I report a bug?

Learn about our [bug bounty and potential bounty payouts](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/code/bug-bounty).

## Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our [Finding Contracts page](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/code/smart-contracts/finding-contracts).

## Why does it say I have no BNB balance?

If you've already [transferred BNB into your Binance Smart Chain-enabled wallet](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/get-started/bep20-guide) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Binance Smart Chain (BSC) selected.

## How do I vote?

## Is ChampagneSwap protected from flashloan attacks?

ChampagneSwap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. ChampagneSwap’s CHAM token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, CHAM token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

ChampagneSwap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.

## Can I join the ChampagneSwap team?

Check the [Become a Chef](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/hiring/become-a-chef) area for information on open positions we're looking to fill.

We advertise new positions we're looking to fill on our [official social media channels](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/contact-us/telegram), so be sure to follow us to get the latest hiring information.

## What is CRISTAL?

CRISTAL was a part of the staking process earlier in ChampagneSwap's life. CRISTAL was discontinued when a security issue was discovered and is no longer a part of ChampagneSwap.
