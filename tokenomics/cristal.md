# Cristal \(Staking\)

**Stack your CHAM with cristal.**

* 25% of CHAM emissions will be distributed to Cristal holders every block. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.
* CHAM holders can swap CHAM for CRISTAL at a 1:1 ratio.
* CHAM is distributed proportionally at each block based on CRISTAL holdings.
* We will only record and distribute CHAM rewards to the wallet address that initiated the CRISTAL staking. While Cristal can be sent to other addresses only the initiating address will receive the CHAM rewards,
