# How to Stake in Cristal Pools with BscScan

![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-2-%20%282%29.png)

Some users may want to take advantage of ChampagneSwap's Cristal Pools using BscScan instead of the website UI.

You'll be interacting with one of two contracts, depending on if you want to use the Auto CHAM Cristal Pool, or one of the other available Cristal Pools. This guide will help you through interacting with the contracts and get you stacking those sweet, cristaly rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please understand that using BscScan to interact with contracts is not recommended for beginners. If you're not feeling confident, we suggest using the [How to Stake in Cristal Pools guide](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/products/cristal-pool/cristal-pool-guide) instead.
