# How to Stake in Cristal Pools

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/docs masthead (15) (1).png>)

Staking in [Cristal Pools](https://docs.panchamswap.finance/products/cristal-pool) lets you earn CHAM or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with ChampagneSwap's Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually CHAM.

## **Getting started with Cristal Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page [here](https://panchamswap.finance/pools).

2\. Connect to your Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Click **Unlock Wallet**.

4\. Choose which Cristal Pool you want to stake in.

**Auto CHAM** automatically compounds your rewards: any CHAM you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you.

**Manual CHAM** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto CHAM. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

Other Cristal Pools let you stake your CHAM to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.\

5\. Once you choose a pool, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Enable button should now be replaced with **Stake**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

9\. The Confirm button will change to **"**Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Cristal Pool. Auto CHAM will show a countdown until the unstaking fee ends. The other pools will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing CHAM from a pool** ****

You can easily  add more CHAM to a Cristal Pool, or move some CHAM to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked CHAM.

1\. Click the **-** to take some CHAM out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

Please note that unstaking from the Auto CHAM pool has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.
