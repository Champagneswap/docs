# Auto CHAM Cristal Pool

## Stake CHAM, earn CHAM!

You've now got two delicious flavors of CHAM-CHAM Cristal Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding, and Manual. Read on to learn more!

![Auto CHAM & Manual CHAM Pools](<../../.gitbook/assets/auto and manual pools.png>)

### What’s the difference between the “Auto CHAM Pool” and the “Manual CHAM Pool”? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your CHAM tokens to earn more CHAM tokens.**&#x20;

But there are some differences:

**Manual CHAM**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your CHAM by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits [SYRUP Token](cristal-pool-faq.md#whats-cristal-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto CHAM**

* Stake your CHAM and forget about it! The CHAM you stake in this Cristal Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit SYRUP to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto CHAM Cristal Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee**&#x20;

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more CHAM in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 CHAM, then 0.02 CHAM would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The CHAM collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular CHAM token burns.&#x20;

This is a good thing for CHAM holders because it reduces the overall amount of CHAM tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### What's the best way to use the Auto CHAM Cristal Pool? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your CHAM, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto CHAM bounty?

**Auto CHAM Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto CHAM pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto CHAM Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of CHAM you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
